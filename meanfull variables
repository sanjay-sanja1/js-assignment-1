 Clear and descriptive variable names make your code easier to read and understand for yourself and others who might work with or maintain it in the future. 
When someone else reads your code, they should be able to quickly grasp the purpose and context of each variable without needing to decipher cryptic or ambiguous names.
Well-named variables reduce the cognitive load required to comprehend the code, making it easier to maintain and modify. When you revisit your code after some time, 
descriptive variable names serve as helpful reminders of the intended functionality, 
reducing the chances of introducing bugs while making modifications.
Descriptive variable names facilitate collaboration among team members by providing clear communication about the purpose and usage of each variable.
When working in a team, meaningful variable names help ensure everyone is on the same page and can easily understand each other's code.
