JavaScript and HTML are both essential components of web development, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. 
Here are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML, along with examples of situations where you would use each:
JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
It is used to manipulate the content of HTML elements, handle user interactions, validate form data, create animations, 
make asynchronous requests to servers (AJAX), and much more.
JavaScript code is executed by the web browser's JavaScript engine.
