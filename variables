The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve memory space to store data values that can be used and manipulated throughout the program. 
  Variables allow developers to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, making the code more flexible and dynamic. 
  Additionally, variables provide a way to give meaningful names to data values, improving code readability and maintainability.
