Unary Operators:

Unary operators act on a single operand.
Examples include:
Unary plus (+): Converts its operand to a number. If the operand cannot be converted to a number, it returns NaN.
Unary minus (-): Negates its operand.
Increment (++): Increases the value of its operand by 1.
Decrement (--): Decreases the value of its operand by 1.
Logical NOT (!): Returns false if its single operand can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.
Binary Operators:

Binary operators act on two operands.
Examples include:
Addition (+): Adds two operands.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one operand from another.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Division (/): Divides one operand by another.
Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
Equality (==, ===): Compares two operands for equality.
Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true; otherwise, returns false.
Ternary Operator:

The ternary operator is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands.
It is also known as the conditional operator.
Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2
It evaluates the condition, and if it's true, it returns expression1; otherwise, it returns expression2.
